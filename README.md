# CODSOFT-TASK3
I’m excited to inform you that I’ve completed my third task, which was the UI design for the e-commerce website at Codsoft. 
The design is now fully realized and ready for your review!
I’m enthusiastic about the progress we’re making and am eager to continue contributing to our projects. 
If there are any additional tasks or next steps you’d like me to focus on, please let me know.
Here is it's Figma file :
